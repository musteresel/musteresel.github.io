This is a simple test post. Let's start off with some code, first
`inline` and then also an code block:

```C
int main() {
  // A long line to test --------------- 80 column --------------------------->|
  static int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14};
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Hopefully this will work. And then:

> Never touch a running system.

That's all for now!
