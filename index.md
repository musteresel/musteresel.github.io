Welcome to my blog. My name is Daniel alias "musteresel". You'll find
here posts about programming in general, programming languages, and
also some occasional theory. Most of the time I program in C, C++ or
Common Lisp. If you want, you can [contact me][]. If you want, you can
also learn more [about me][].
