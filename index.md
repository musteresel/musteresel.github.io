Welcome to my blog. My name is Daniel alias "musteresel". You'll find
here posts about programming in general, programming languages, linux
and NixOS related stuff and also some occasional theory. Most of the
time I program in C, C++, Common Lisp or Python.

If you want, you can [contact me][]. If you want, you can
also learn more [about me][].
