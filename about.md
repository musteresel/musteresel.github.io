My name is Daniel Jour.  Before I got married you'd call me Daniel
Oertwig, though.  I'm an enthusiastic hobby programmer with more than
10 years of experience.  I've a B.Sc. in Aerospace Computer Science
and am currently finishing my M.Sc in Computer Science.  I've stumbled
over (and into) all kinds of technologies, tools and stuff.

Apart from Computer Science and Programming related stuff I really
like [psbattles](https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/).

*Why **musteresel**?*

Well, I'm German, and our equivalent of "John Doe" is "Max
Mustermann".  I had to choose a nickname for some site, but
"mustermann" was already taken.  I was a bit upset that I wasn't the
first fool to try that obvious name, so I replaced the "-mann" (*man*)
with "-esel" (*donkey*, but colloquially used to mean *fool*) and -
tada - that name wasn't already taken.
