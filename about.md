My name is Daniel Jour.  Before I got married you'd call me Daniel
Oertwig, though.  I'm a freelance software engineer and an enthusiastic
hobby programmer with more than 20 years of experience.
I've a M.Sc in Computer Science and a
B.Sc. in Aerospace Computer Science.  I've stumbled
over (and into) all kinds of technologies, tools and stuff.

Apart from Computer Science and Programming related stuff I really
like [psbattles](https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/).

*Why **musteresel**?*

Well, I'm German, and our equivalent of "John Doe" is "Max
Mustermann".  I had to choose a nickname for some site, but
"mustermann" was already taken.  I was a bit upset that I wasn't the
first fool to try that obvious name, so I replaced the "-mann" (*man*)
with "-esel" (*donkey*, but colloquially used to mean *fool*) and -
tada - that name wasn't already taken.

## Contact

Just write me an email:

  var elements = document.getElementsByClassName("not-my-info")
  for (var i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
    elements[i].innerHTML = "";
  }
}
</script>
